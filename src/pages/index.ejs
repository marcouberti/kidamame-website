                        <strong>We are a small independent studio, from parents to parents.</strong> We create calm,
                        offline, and ad-free <strong>apps</strong> designed for primary school children (ages 4-10). Our
                        goal is simple: to help families slow down and rediscover the joy of curiosity through nature
                        and science. No noise, no addiction, just a safe space to explore together.

                        Welcome to <strong>Kidamame Discovery</strong>, our calm, interactive world designed for
                        families. Rooted in <strong>Montessori principles</strong>,
                        this experience offers <strong>meaningful screen time</strong> for children ages 4-10. We
                        replace fast-paced goals and instructions
                        with <strong>child-led exploration</strong>, inviting kids to touch, play, and learn at their
                        own pace. Each <strong>sensory-rich</strong> scene is an
                        illustrated storybook come to life, where tapping an animal or plant reveals beautiful "Did You
                        Know?" cards.
                        It’s a magical, ad-free space for families to slow down, spark <strong>curiosity</strong>, and
                        share moments of wonder together.
